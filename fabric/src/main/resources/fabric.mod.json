  "description": "A mod focused on adding new building blocks with customizability and interactions!\\n\\n§c§l§u§o! Pre-releases WILL be buggy ! §cPlease report any issues on our GitHub or Discord.\\n\\n§9§l§uCHANGELOG (2.0pre2)§7\\n- Frames' code has been almost entirely redone; they no longer connect to non-solid blocks or blocks with smaller models.\\n- Layers now have a rotate/mirror method -- this should allow them to properly save and load when put into structures. \\n- Block descriptions now use \"Left Control\" instead of \"Left Shift\" to show their tooltips. I had noticed that when trying to fast-transfer them to containers you would sort of get flashbanged. \\n- Fixed HangingEntityMixin - should now have a higher priority + survive while in Frames \\n- Columns now have proper waterlogging - if their layers have not been removed, they can not be waterlogged. If their layers are replaced, they will lose any existing waterlogged state. \\n- Added Hammer compatibility with Another Furniture. \\n- Removed buggy \"Paintings surviving in Frames\" mechanic\n",
